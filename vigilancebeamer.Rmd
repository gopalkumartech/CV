# Introduction

## What is Vendor Management

### Make or buy decision

- We outsource certain products or services as partner vendors can offer better service/product or a better economy.
- Businesses rarely have all the resources to execute projects and fulfill business objectives on their own. 

### Vendor is a partner
- Vendor gives better technology or service /cost economies
- must be nurtured
- within the Government rules of constitutional equality among persons/business entities 

## Vendor management : conception to disposal

### Vendor Management 

- Complete process of acquiring and managing suppliers 
- with different points of contact, rates, and contract terms 
- in complex and highly dynamic buyer-vendor ecosystem.


### General key points in Vendor selection

- Select vendors that present greatest value  at the least viable expenditure.
- Mission-critical vendor associate for their concerns and relationship.
- Building long term trust and mutual support is Important
- Needs to fit into overall delivery of service and corporate strategy 
- Understand vendor’s business model as bottom line for Vendor is and important and cost and delivery pressure on them will likely see a commensurate reduction in service/product quality.


# Vendor development in Railways

### Vendor development in Railways 

- Most aspect of vendor management handled by Stores department 
- Item demands, technical requirements and usage feedback performance report by user departments

### For safety critical items - vendor pre approval

- For safety and critical items, vendors are pre-approved by RDSO/PU
- RDSO  approve vendors for for items assigned by Railway Board
- RDSO vendor development and management is only a limited part of entire vendor management 


# RDSO vendor development system 

The presentation will cover few key points of `RDSO vendor registration process`


### RDSO vendor management activities

1. Item identified and assigned by Railway Board 
2. RDSO develop Specification including STR and indicative costing
3. RDSO Solicit vendors interest
4. Entire Vendor Application processing on RDSO UVAM portal at ireps.gov.in
5. Undertake Inspection of classified Category-II critical items 
6. Evaluate Vendor performance for up-gradation and corrective actions
6. Failure reporting monitoring and regular and special audits 

## RDSO Vendor Development process and monitoring

### Specification development

- RDSO follow the basic principles of WTO-TBT ‘Code of Good Practice for the Preparation, Adoption and Application of Standards’. 

- The six principles of standardisation:
     a) Transparency 
     b) Openness 
     c) Impartiality and Consensus 
     d) Effectiveness and Relevance
     e) Coherence 
     f) Development Dimension


## Standards


### What are Standards
> Document established by consensus amongst various stakeholders and provides for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for specific products or services and is aimed at achieving optimum degree of order in a given context. 
These could be specifications, procedures and guidelines to ensure that products, services and systems are safe, consistent and reliable. 


### Development of Specifications 
- Product conceptualisation  
- Overall functional requirement specifications of the product
- Who can make it best - ourself or other person (vendor)
- Mostly, Vendor specifications made in consultation with stakeholders for optimum cost and functionality 


## Standards development process of RDSO

### Justificatons for New specifications/STR
a) Why the need for creation of new Standard has arisen? 
b) What is the existing Vendor base and the action plan to develop new vendors?
c) What will be the Pricing of the item? (Some indicative estimation of pricing of the item shall be indicated in note for information) 

### Changes in the Existing RDSO Standards
Changes of raw material / process / testing /procedures / guidelines or validation of product or services. 

a) Why the need for Change has arisen?
b) parameters likely to be affected?
c) Effect of change on the existing vendor base?
d) Effect of the change on the pricing of the item.
e) Effect on service life of component/equipment.
f) Mechanisms for effective monitoring those parameters
g) Any other remarks

# Vendor Monitoring and performance evaluation

## Performance Feedback reports from user Railways

1. RDSO web portal hosted on railnet website 10.100.12.19
2. Feed back from Railways (Discouraged as subjective)
3. Online failure reporting work flow from Freight Maintenance Management (FMM)/CMM/WMS (better system to be formalised)

## Evaluation of performance (para 4.4 )
- Based on feedback from user as available in the directorate during quality audit. 
- Refusal to Quality Audit Date of Quality Audit intimated to firm through email/fax at least 30 days in advance. (Para 4.5)

- In case approved vendor refuses to quality audit or does not allow RDSO to perform quality audit, vendor temporarily delisted till  quality audit is successfully done.

## Quality and performance deterioration

Deterioration of performance & out of turn Quality Audit (Para 4.6 )

- ED decide out of turn quality audit for further continuance of approval/ temporary delisting/ delisting.
- ED/ PED may decide to  stop the inspection temporarily considering seriousness 
- Audit Report communicated and  vendor status be updated on website (Para 4.7 )
- Discrepancies during Quality Audits be taken up with show cause notice to comply deficiencies , and implementing CAPA within 30 days. This shall be verified. (Para 4.8)

- If the firm fails to comply, firm be temporary delisted 


## Inspections ( Suggestions) 

- Inspection - Adds no values to quality, waste of resource but essential under mistrusted vendors

- Better develop strong and trusted vendors with lasting relationships with suppliers.
- Firms WTC may be considered depending on robustness of firms QAP and mitigation activities

- Private sector insists on process monitoring from its manufacturers. Instead of checking a complete lot and then rejecting it, we need to look into that aspect. That brings quality and eases inspection for the supplier

## Quality key items to consider (suggestions)

### 7 QC tools -  Prof. Ishikawa, Tokyo Univ 
Solves about ~ 95% of problems 

1. Pareto Chart
2. Run Chart - run-sequence plot
3. Histogram - underlying distribution - process capability
4. Cause-and-effect diagram - Ishikawa fishbone diagram : root causes effect into six Ms: measurement, material, machine, method, manpower and mother nature.  Brainstorming "why does this happen?" 
5. Scatter plots : X-Y graph data relationship but no  causation
6. Control charts : processes variation from specs.( x-bar ,  R , S , c , u , np and p chart)
7. Check Sheets : defect concentration diagram, structured forms

Vendors following above likely to have robust internal quality control system

---

### Vendor supplies performance monitoring: 

- Warranty portal and in future FMM/CMM/WMS in mech deptt 
- Reliability analyses and life tables statistical analysis with censured data 
- Consider Total effective life cycle cost
- Good vendors are assets  and proved values to the business

## Few Suggestions for discussions

### Documentation and legal compliances 
- Based on certificate from statutory charted accountant
- All CCA compliance by chartered engineering firms
- RDSO can always verify and cross check certificates
- like system of Advocates in Court, CA for company accounts, CHA for export

- Ways to incentivise vendors meeting better process capabilities (Cp)
